Keep the high score and display this in the title screen.

Alien random shooting (would be nice to avoid "friendly fire").

Alien shots hit player which shows the ShipDeath costume, plays a sound, and decreases the lives.

When lives is zero, show the game over screen.

Alien shots put holes in shields. (needs engine feature)

Two player mode (take turns) - this will use 2 instances of PlayScreen.

Other Example Games:
  Asteroids
  Platform
  Simple conversation type

Background layers should be able to check for collisions with sprites.

Background layers should be stampable and can have masks applied to cut holes in them.

Add background layers feature - scrollable by px or %

BounceOnEdge

Sprite PlaySound change volume

Animated costumes

Visual Effects

Sprite transitions (fade out, fade in, etc)

Multiple text animations at the same time.

One-shot text animations: Grow, Shrink, FadeIn, FadeOut, Shake

Full screen, or square screen. How's that going to work?

Gamescreen - clip to -100 to 100 mode - draw black on the edges or create a square window

Create an instructions web page that has the Scratch block and the equivalent ScratchyXNA code - Half done
